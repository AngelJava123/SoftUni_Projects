promtool.exe is an executable binary file that provides a command-line interface (CLI) for various utility functions related 
to Prometheus configuration and rule files. It is a separate utility from the Prometheus server itself.

The promtool.exe binary is typically used for validating and linting Prometheus configuration files (prometheus.yml) and 
rule files (rules.yml). It helps ensure that the configuration and rules are correctly formatted, follow the Prometheus syntax, and adhere to best practices.

Some common use cases of promtool.exe include:

Configuration file validation: promtool.exe can be used to validate the syntax and correctness of a Prometheus configuration 
file (prometheus.yml). It checks for errors, such as invalid YAML formatting, missing required fields, or unsupported configuration options.

Rule file validation: With promtool.exe, you can validate the syntax and structure of Prometheus rule files (rules.yml). It
ensures that the rules are defined correctly, follow the PromQL query language, and comply with the rule format expected by Prometheus.

Linting and best practices: promtool.exe can perform linting on both configuration files and rule files, checking for potential 
issues, deprecated configuration options, or common mistakes that might affect the performance or reliability of the Prometheus setup.

By running promtool.exe with the appropriate commands and options, you can verify the correctness of your Prometheus configuratio
n and rule files before starting the Prometheus server. This helps to identify any misconfigurations or errors early on and ensures a smooth operation of the Prometheus monitoring system.

Note that the specific commands and options available in promtool.exe may vary depending on the version of Prometheus you are using.

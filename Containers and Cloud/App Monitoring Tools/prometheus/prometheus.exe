prometheus.exe is an executable binary file that is part of the Prometheus monitoring system. It is the main component responsible for collecting and 
storing time-series data, as well as evaluating rules and generating alerts based on the defined metrics and thresholds.

Prometheus is designed to monitor and gather metrics from various sources, such as applications, services, operating systems,
and network devices. It scrapes data from configured targets using various protocols (e.g., HTTP, SNMP) and stores the collected time-series data in its own storage system.

The prometheus.exe binary is the executable file for running the Prometheus server. It is used to start the Prometheus process 
and handle data collection, metrics storage, rule evaluation, and alerting.

When running prometheus.exe, you typically provide a configuration file (often named prometheus.yml) that defines the targets
to be scraped, the rules for evaluating metrics, and the alerting configurations.

In summary, prometheus.exe is the executable file for running the Prometheus server, which is responsible for data collection,
storage, rule evaluation, and alerting in the Prometheus monitoring system.
